functions.py

This is an example of how you can use the Python SDK's built-in Function connector to easily write Python code.
When you add a Python Lambda connector to your Hasura project, this file is generated for you!

In this file you'll find code examples that will help you get up to speed with the usage of the Hasura lambda connector.
If you are an old pro and already know what is going on you can get rid of these example functions and start writing your own code.
